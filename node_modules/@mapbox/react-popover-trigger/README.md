# @mapbox/react-popover-trigger

Interact with the content of a PopoverTrigger to open and close a Popover.
 
This component internally manages the open-closed state of the Popover. If you 
want to manage it yourself, use `react-popover` directly.
 
`respondsToClick`, `respondsToHover`, and `respondsToFocus` props determine the
means of opening and closing the Popover with interactions. If you open the 
Popover with a hover or focus, you can also close it by hovering away or 
blurring. If, however, you open the Popover with a click, you can only close it 
with another click, on the trigger or outside the Popover. If you've opened the 
Popover with a hover and then you click, it is then considered to be opened 
with a click and will only close with another click (not hovering away).

## Installation
